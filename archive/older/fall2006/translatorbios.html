She collaborated on a prize-winning libretto at the  International Hans Christian Andersen Musical Competition in Odense, Denmark in  1980, co-authored an article on the development of the imperative in Early  Modern English, and has published two translated short stories in <em>Two Lines</em> and one in <em>Passport: The Arkansas Review  of Literary Translation</em>.<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About  translating “The Lad,” she says: As always, translating a story by Ervin Lázár  was a delight.&nbsp;&nbsp; This  particular story presented few linguistic challenges for the translator, once I  had made the initial decision about handling names, allusions to Hungarian  folklore, and word play.&nbsp; My  primary aim was to preserve the author’s voice while emphasizing the universal  over the particular.&nbsp; In terms of  word choice this meant paying attention to the semantic field of all nouns,  verbs, and adjectives, and finding an equivalent with the most similar semantic  field and the most similar emotional “load.”&nbsp; <br />
            The  names of characters were changed, or minimally Anglicized, but I attempted to  retain their playfulness and the nature of the puns or allusions involved in  them.&nbsp; For example, I changed the  name of the clown, Lembozo Virtuoso, from the original Lembozó Lengubozó,  because the meanings involved in the last name (<em>len</em> = flax, <em>gubó</em> = cocoon) and the alliteration did not  trump the need for a name that rhymes.&nbsp;  I would have liked to preserve the alliteration, but none of the Italian  adjectives ending in –oso and beginning with l (<em>laborioso, lacrimoso,  laggiuso, lassuso, lasuso, lattoso, lazaroso, lebbroso, lezioso, libidinoso,  licentioso, licenzioso, limaccioso</em>)  were as easy for an English-speaking reader to understand as Virtuoso, while  some of them (<em>libidonoso, licentioso</em>) would have been downright inappropriate.&nbsp; The meaning I introduced with Virtuoso  appears to be a good fit with the old clown’s original profession.&nbsp; Of course I could have easily changed  the first name, but since it included –bozo, which is highly appropriate for a  clown, I decided to keep it.&nbsp; <br />
            The  Lad was another conscious choice: the Hungarian word <em>Fiú</em> (ordinarily in lower case, but Lázár  indicates this was the only name he was ever known by) means boy or lad.&nbsp; Hungarian folk tales frequently involve  three sons who go through a trial, in which the youngest generally triumphs  because of the goodness of his heart.&nbsp;  I tried to evoke the association with folk tales by choosing the more  archaic term.&nbsp; Benny Bean’s name,  if translated strictly, would be Bertie Bean, but I found that the former rolls  off the tongue much easier in English, and since Lázár uses the characters’  full name almost every time, this was an important consideration.&nbsp; In my discussions with the author I was  guided to model my translation after Frigyes Karinthy’s masterful rendering of <em>Winnie-the-Pooh</em> in Hungarian, which uses similar techniques  to reduce alterity by adopting playful Hungarian names for all characters and  places.</p>

After  growing up in rural Ohio, O’Brien ran off as soon as she was able to live in  places like Paris and Cape Town.&nbsp;  She doesn’t know where she’ll run off to next. Her complete translation  of Ryoko Sekiguchi’s <em>Heliotropes </em>is  slated for publication in the fall of 2007.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <strong></strong></p>

She first came to the U.S. on a Department  of State scholarship in 1999. After graduating from her hometown university,  she returned to Nebraska to pursue a graduate degree in creative writing. Her  translations have been published or are forthcoming in <em>Agni</em>, <em>Prairie Schooner</em>, and <em>Transfusions</em>. She&nbsp;has also published some original  poetry and co-edited, with Ladette Randolph <em>The Big Empty: An Anthology of  Nebraska Non-Fiction</em> due  from UNP in the spring of 2007.&nbsp;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; About  translating “Military Scenes,” she says: Andrukhovych’s poems’ greatest appeal,  as well as their greatest challenge, is the writer’s virtuoso command of the  Ukrainian language, the incredible range of his tonal repertoire, and  painstaking formal refinement. I have always approached this particular book, <em>Exotic  Birds and Plants, </em>more as a  writer than a reader, and in translation this approach proved most effective.  These are not the kind of poems that, through the process of holistic critical  reading, can be rebuilt from scratch, “rewritten,” so to speak, in English; on  the contrary, Andrukhovych’s tightly wrought wordplay requires deference and  attention to detail.<br />
            As a poet and as a translator I favor rhythm  as my baseline. From there, I seek a grasp of the syntactic movement through  the line—Andrukhovych rarely enjambs his phrases. Last, I attempt to train my  ear to hear the original rhymes. The rhymes don’t often make it into the  English text, but in translating Andrukhovych one cannot abandon rhyme  entirely. I always try to preserve some similarity of sound, as in, for  example, “arts–ours,” “fails-waist,” and “roams-ovens.”<br />
            “Military Scenes” is a good example of  Andrukhovych’s varied diction and technique. In “Kolomya Regiment in Paris” it  was important to acknowledge the communal voice and the incantatorial quality  of the phrasing that made the tone of the poem elegiac.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; “The  Demise of Kotliarevskism” is an intentionally difficult poem, and the title is  the key to enter it :Kotlyarevsky’s <em>Eneida</em> scandalized and delighted readers with its liberal use of what  was considered marginal, dialectic, and even vulgar vocabulary. Andrukhovych’s  elegy reincarnates the imagery (Didona, Sybil) and the spirit of that rogue  Ukrainian epic. <br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I  consider Andrukhovych’s linguistic density a blessing in disguise, because I  can always trust the original to yield its imagery, its internal ties, through  carefully matched words—Andrukhovych’s images are descriptive far more often  than they are metaphorical. But the reader, as always, will be the judge.</p>
